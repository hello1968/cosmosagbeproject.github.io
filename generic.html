									<p>Iâ€™m a Versatile and analytical Data Scientist with 10 years of specialized experience in health informatics and biostatistics. Currently serving as a Health Information Officer (Biostatistics) in the Health Sector, where I championed data management and do serious statistical analysis using any data related to health, to enhance public health strategies and operational improvements. My role involves leveraging advanced data analytics to inform policy development and sustainable development goals in healthcare delivery.
										In addition to my full-time position, I actively contribute to academia as a part-time Lecturer in the Biostatistics and Epidemiology department of the University of Health and Allied Sciences (a public university in Ghana), where I support and deliver comprehensive coursework that deepens students' understanding of data science principles and this enables them to do their research works in healthcare.  Again, as a data scientist and statistician serving as Senior Tutor in Distance Education (University of Cape Cost, Ghana) , I teach several statistical courses and supervise students in writing their project works and thesis; most students are now data professionals. I impart high knowledge in information technology, share my great skills with any organization, and make sure they excel rapidly in data science.
